# Droplet-Imaging-on-Drone-Propeller

This experiment is to study the effect of droplets on the drone propeller. Later on, we intend to do image segmentation and edge detection using Python. 

It is powered using an Arduino UNO R3, along with a L293D Shield for the Arduino, DSLR Camera using a prime lens, and octocoupler for detecting the droplets.
