# Droplet-Imaging-on-Drone-Propeller

This experiment is to study the effect of droplets on the drone propeller. Later on, we intend to do image segmentation and edge detection using Python. 

It is powered using an **Arduino UNO R3**, along with a **L293D IC** for the Arduino,**DSLR Camera using a prime lens**, and **octocoupler** for detecting the droplets. 

   1) The file [alignment_check.ino](https://github.com/abhiraaam/Droplet-Imaging-on-Drone-Propeller/blob/main/alignment_check.ino) is used to conduct a test for the       experimental setup.
   2) The file [propeller_control.ino](https://github.com/abhiraaam/Droplet-Imaging-on-Drone-Propeller/blob/main/propeller_control.ino) was merged into                     [setup_control.ino](https://github.com/abhiraaam/Droplet-Imaging-on-Drone-Propeller/blob/main/setup_control.ino) so that by the time the DC Motor completes one       rotation, the probability of impacting the propeller becomes high. It can be adjusted by varying the time delay in the code.
